# Installation and Running Guide for Non-Engineers (Mac Users)

This guide is intended for non-engineers, such as designers, who wish to install and run the Figma AppAgent feature using the provided command files on a Mac.

## Installation

We provide an `install.command` script to automate the installation process. After downloading the script, you may need to give it execution permissions. This can be done by opening the Terminal, navigating to the directory where the script is saved, and running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x install.command
```

Now, you can install the dependencies and verify the installation by double-clicking the `install.command` script. If the installation is successful, you will see the message "Installation successful." in the Terminal.

## Running the AppAgent

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can run the Figma AppAgent feature by double-clicking the `run.command` script. 

This will open the GUI, and you can start using the Figma AppAgent feature. The GUI provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Figma AppAgent feature, making it easy even for non-engineers to use.

**For Windows and Linux users:** This guide is specifically for Mac users. If you are using Windows or Linux, please refer to the original README.md document for installation and running instructions.
